There are some mistletoe clumps of reasonably large size with very ripe berries. The recent rains have pushed tiny shoots of winter grass in this was as well as those seen yesterday [on Parker 34-36]. There are piles of freshly dropped leaves underneath all fo the ironwoods here though the trees do not show it. Strangely, here as nowhere else I have seen locally, the wash ran as a result of the winter rains. The sand appears wet and saturated still.""

Other vertebrates noted: Lepus californicus - 1; Ammospermophilus leucurus - 1.--I noted the lack of any member of the sparrow guild and ground feeders - likely because the wash had run and washed all the seeds away. I also noted that I detected higher numbers of verdins and gnatcatchers than the previous month possibly because the birds are pairing up and are more vocal and visible. Also more Phainopeplas though they don't seem to be pairing yet. Some are giving a quiet twittery song.--I noted that this wash appeared to have run water within the last month although the last rain I could remember was on 6 November, one day prior to my last visit to these transects. On that day I had noted  that the wash was quite wet but did not appear to have run. That day in December I was unable to find my footprints from 7 November and, without running, those prints would still have been there. I wondered if there'd been another storm in those mountains since that we'd not noticed in Ehrenberg. Whatever the case, there had to have been some water in the wash as the Lycium in this wash which put out new growth in late September, died back quickly between then and November, but was now putting out much more new growth than it had in September.--Plant notes: Opuntia basillaris; O. rammosissima;Pectis papposa (blooming); Encelia frutescens; Coldenia plicata and Dalea emoryi over by the cliff edge; Atriplex polycarpa (with mature seed); Datura meteloides; Encelia farinosa; Euphorbia polycarpa; Euphorbia sp.; and Asclepias subulata (blooming); Hilaria rigida was found scattered amongst the adjacent creosote flats.

No significant visible damage. This was the only type V desert wash transect due to the size of the taller trees in the wash - the vegetation is very sparse compared to the type VI east side washes. Lycium dormant here (in contrast to the leafed out and flowering plants in the east side washes). Some of the smoke trees had put out a few blossoms that were just opening and Stephanomeria also in bloom.--Ash-throated Flycatchers have vacated these washes now.

However, much less effect, relatively, here from rains in September. I noted Lycium leafing out in October here but almost every plant has lost most of those leaves or, at the very least, they have dried up. Only one plant had a few green leaves remaining. Found two individuals of Physalis crassifolia with fruit from flowers that bloomed in response to those rains, however. The mistletoe berries were ""mostly new but a few are nearly ripe and the Phainopeplas are already eating them - only 1 Phainopepla was here on 10/9...""--I wondered if the D. merriami noted below had gotten wet and died from hypothermia overnight - maybe the wash did run or that animal's burrow got saturated somehow. There were no injuries evident on the animal. Saw loose flocks of feeding birds containing juncos, YRWA, verdins, gnatcatchers, white-crowns, and one Lincoln's Sparrow.

Also more Phainopeplas though they don't seem to be pairing yet. Some are giving a quiet twittery song.--I noted that this wash appeared to have run water within the last month although the last rain I could remember was on 6 November, one day prior to my last visit to these transects. On that day I had noted  that the wash was quite wet but did not appear to have run. That day in December I was unable to find my footprints from 7 November and, without running, those prints would still have been there. I wondered if there'd been another storm in those mountains since that we'd not noticed in Ehrenberg. Whatever the case, there had to have been some water in the wash as the Lycium in this wash which put out new growth in late September, died back quickly between then and November, but was now putting out much more new growth than it had in September.--Plant notes: Opuntia basillaris; O. rammosissima;Pectis papposa (blooming); Encelia frutescens; Coldenia plicata and Dalea emoryi over by the cliff edge; Atriplex polycarpa (with mature seed); Datura meteloides; Encelia farinosa; Euphorbia polycarpa; Euphorbia sp.; and Asclepias subulata (blooming); Hilaria rigida was found scattered amongst the adjacent creosote flats.

However, much less effect, relatively, here from rains in September. I noted Lycium leafing out in October here but almost every plant has lost most of those leaves or, at the very least, they have dried up. Only one plant had a few green leaves remaining. Found two individuals of Physalis crassifolia with fruit from flowers that bloomed in response to those rains, however. The mistletoe berries were ""mostly new but a few are nearly ripe and the Phainopeplas are already eating them - only 1 Phainopepla was here on 10/9...""--I wondered if the D. merriami noted below had gotten wet and died from hypothermia overnight - maybe the wash did run or that animal's burrow got saturated somehow. There were no injuries evident on the animal. Saw loose flocks of feeding birds containing juncos, YRWA, verdins, gnatcatchers, white-crowns, and one Lincoln's Sparrow.

While I scoped the pond, Tom worked both north and south along the road to find additional vantage points in search of the heron.

While I scoped the pond, Tom worked both north and south along the road to find additional vantage points in search of the heron.  The pond was about 100 meters across and approximately 200 meters long, with extensive dead vegetation (likely tamarisk trees) to the south that created the appearance of a wooded swamp, but there were also scattered stands of cattails along the shoreline mixed with scrubby tamarisk shrubs of various sizes.  The result of the densely vegetated borders to the pond was that many of the birds seen were visible only intermittently between long periods of obscurity.  Although we could scan much of the pond from our positions, our coverage for land birds in particular was quite limited and representing primarily what I could hear from my position.

The most noteworthy observation was probably that of at least 1000 White-faced Ibis coming in to either feed or roost on the far side of the pond, but during our brief stop we did our best to scan from the roadside the birds that were concentrated mostly on the far side of the lake.  Given the brevity and late timing of our visit, this list is best considered an incomplete one that concentrated on the birds in and along the edges of the pond, with land birds mostly heard incidentally. -- It was clear, calm, and 65° F on our arrival (based on the thermometer in my vehicle).  4:40-4:50 pm.

The most noteworthy observation was probably that of at least 1000 White-faced Ibis coming in to either feed or roost on the far side of the pond, but during our brief stop we did our best to scan from the roadside the birds that were concentrated mostly on the far side of the lake.  Given the brevity and late timing of our visit, this list is best considered an incomplete one that concentrated on the birds in and along the edges of the pond, with land birds mostly heard incidentally. -- It was clear, calm, and 65° F on our arrival (based on the thermometer in my vehicle).  4:40-4:50 pm.

The most noteworthy observation was probably that of at least 1000 White-faced Ibis coming in to either feed or roost on the far side of the pond, but during our brief stop we did our best to scan from the roadside the birds that were concentrated mostly on the far side of the lake.  Given the brevity and late timing of our visit, this list is best considered an incomplete one that concentrated on the birds in and along the edges of the pond, with land birds mostly heard incidentally. -- It was clear, calm, and 65° F on our arrival (based on the thermometer in my vehicle).  4:40-4:50 pm.

Our first stop along the way was at the Quail Hollow Picnic Area, where we looked for Sage Sparrows and Crissal Thrashers in the desert and scattered mesquite stands to the east of the site, and then walked a quick loop around the clearing checking the trees.  We did not stay long at this site, so I suspect the list below is an incomplete one for the area as a whole.  It was clear, calm, and 82º F, based on the thermometer in Brad's vehicle.  3:20-4:00 pm.

I again carefully walked the golf course, but today I also walked around the northern part of the campground and along the river, and before leaving the site I drove a loop around the entire resort, which was again unproductive.  My efforts were concentrated around the lawns and scattered trees on the golf course, b I also checked the trees in the northern part of the trailer park, and the trees, scrub, and shoreline bordering the river.  It was clear, essentially calm, and with temperatures increasing from 80° F to 96° F during my morning visit.  6:55-8:40 am.----Wild Burro - 10;--Desert Cottontail - 3.

Given that the cowbirds had been found most easily on the golf course, I walked a circuit of almost the entire course beginning at the marked and working an essentially clockwise loop around the perimeter checking the lawns and adjacent trees, most of which were medium-sized mesquites. but also with with fan palms along the roads.  Following a period spent in the market cooling off, I slowly drove a loop throughout the site looking for birds on the ground and obvious birds in the cottonwoods and other trees scattered about the site.  I found a reasonable selection of the expected species, including at least two family groups of Lucy's Warblers and a family of roadrunners, yet I was unable to locate any cowbirds.  It was clear, with a mild (increasing to 5 knots) breeze from the south, and temperatures that increased from 104° F on my arrival to 111° F on my early-afternoon departure (based on the thermometer in my vehicle).  10:45 am - 1:00 pm.

Given that the cowbirds had been found most easily on the golf course, I walked a circuit of almost the entire course beginning at the marked and working an essentially clockwise loop around the perimeter checking the lawns and adjacent trees, most of which were medium-sized mesquites. but also with with fan palms along the roads.  Following a period spent in the market cooling off, I slowly drove a loop throughout the site looking for birds on the ground and obvious birds in the cottonwoods and other trees scattered about the site.  I found a reasonable selection of the expected species, including at least two family groups of Lucy's Warblers and a family of roadrunners, yet I was unable to locate any cowbirds.  It was clear, with a mild (increasing to 5 knots) breeze from the south, and temperatures that increased from 104° F on my arrival to 111° F on my early-afternoon departure (based on the thermometer in my vehicle).  10:45 am - 1:00 pm.

I again carefully walked the golf course, but today I also walked around the northern part of the campground and along the river, and before leaving the site I drove a loop around the entire resort, which was again unproductive.  My efforts were concentrated around the lawns and scattered trees on the golf course, b I also checked the trees in the northern part of the trailer park, and the trees, scrub, and shoreline bordering the river.  It was clear, essentially calm, and with temperatures increasing from 80° F to 96° F during my morning visit.  6:55-8:40 am.----Wild Burro - 10;--Desert Cottontail - 3.

I again carefully walked the golf course, but today I also walked around the northern part of the campground and along the river, and before leaving the site I drove a loop around the entire resort, which was again unproductive.  My efforts were concentrated around the lawns and scattered trees on the golf course, b I also checked the trees in the northern part of the trailer park, and the trees, scrub, and shoreline bordering the river.  It was clear, essentially calm, and with temperatures increasing from 80° F to 96° F during my morning visit.  6:55-8:40 am.----Wild Burro - 10;--Desert Cottontail - 3.

Given that the cowbirds had been found most easily on the golf course, I walked a circuit of almost the entire course beginning at the marked and working an essentially clockwise loop around the perimeter checking the lawns and adjacent trees, most of which were medium-sized mesquites. but also with with fan palms along the roads.  Following a period spent in the market cooling off, I slowly drove a loop throughout the site looking for birds on the ground and obvious birds in the cottonwoods and other trees scattered about the site.  I found a reasonable selection of the expected species, including at least two family groups of Lucy's Warblers and a family of roadrunners, yet I was unable to locate any cowbirds.  It was clear, with a mild (increasing to 5 knots) breeze from the south, and temperatures that increased from 104° F on my arrival to 111° F on my early-afternoon departure (based on the thermometer in my vehicle).  10:45 am - 1:00 pm.

I again carefully walked the golf course, but today I also walked around the northern part of the campground and along the river, and before leaving the site I drove a loop around the entire resort, which was again unproductive.  My efforts were concentrated around the lawns and scattered trees on the golf course, b I also checked the trees in the northern part of the trailer park, and the trees, scrub, and shoreline bordering the river.  It was clear, essentially calm, and with temperatures increasing from 80° F to 96° F during my morning visit.  6:55-8:40 am.----Wild Burro - 10;--Desert Cottontail - 3.

Given that the cowbirds had been found most easily on the golf course, I walked a circuit of almost the entire course beginning at the marked and working an essentially clockwise loop around the perimeter checking the lawns and adjacent trees, most of which were medium-sized mesquites. but also with with fan palms along the roads.  Following a period spent in the market cooling off, I slowly drove a loop throughout the site looking for birds on the ground and obvious birds in the cottonwoods and other trees scattered about the site.  I found a reasonable selection of the expected species, including at least two family groups of Lucy's Warblers and a family of roadrunners, yet I was unable to locate any cowbirds.  It was clear, with a mild (increasing to 5 knots) breeze from the south, and temperatures that increased from 104° F on my arrival to 111° F on my early-afternoon departure (based on the thermometer in my vehicle).  10:45 am - 1:00 pm.

I also drove up toward Fort Mohave, checking fields and brush along the way,  Burro Flats, and Park Moabi.

The main reason for this list is the Curve-Billed Thrasher.

Restoration folks have taken large blocks of farmland, evidently with an irrigation scheme in place and planted these areas with trees and shrubs to bring back the riparian ecosystem. However, at this stage, the landscape in most of these appears a monoculture of even-aged Fremont Cottonwoods, and completely lacks structural heterogeneity with openings or with a shrub or herb layer. Searching the web, I see no  concern by restoration ecologists or others that the efforts here perhaps warrant a different approach to more closely approximate a functioning riparian ecosystem. The cottonwood blocks may be focused on bringing back Yellow-billed Cuckoos, hugely depleted in California, which appears to be occurring. The cottonwood tracts caught my attention foremost, the other blocks of habitat appear more natural, such as areas of Mesquite thickets near the parking area and at the north end of the site. In those areas, we saw more diversity. Too, areas of rough fields appear more natural, at least based on structural characteristics. In deference to restoration ecologists, perhaps they are planning to introduce disturbance into the landscapes here (to create openings) and prompt growth of elements that will promote structural diversity.

This place and others in the Lower Colorado River Balley are still some of the underbirded gems of socal. 36 degrees at start, 57 at end. I followed Caleb Strand’s usual route, parking at where 2nd street hits the river, then walking along the road upstream for about 1.3 miles, then cutting across to check for Ruddy Ground Doves (none found). I then took the road back downstream from the ruddy ground dove corner) back to the car, checking the ag fields along the way. I then walked a little downstream, checking the hunting ponds adjacent to the river for any waterfowl. There were very few birds in the river, and most waterfowl were flybys early. Passerine activity dropped substantially after about 8:30.

I entered the area on 2nd Avenue. I quickly concluded viewing conditions for raptors from the parking area were somewhat restricted, and after a short time concluded a location along the Colorado River south of 2nd Avenue was much better. From this location adjacent to a large area of mostly open dry grass, I was able to see the “forest” to the south and the “forest” along 2nd Avenue, as well as having the morning sun at my back. As it turned out, this was an excellent choice.
